Customizable Forms Web Application

Description:
Developed a full-featured web application similar to Google Forms, allowing users to create customizable templates for quizzes, surveys, polls, and more. Authenticated users can define templates with various question types, while others can fill out the forms based on these templates. The system includes role-based access control with users and administrators having specific privileges.

Key Features:

Template Creation: Users can create, edit, and manage templates with a variety of question types (text, integer, multiple choice).
Form Management: Ability to submit, edit, and view forms filled out by other users.
Admin Panel: Admins can manage users (block, unblock, delete, assign admin roles) and have full control over all templates and forms.
Real-time Commenting: Linear comments on templates, with automatic updates.
Search and Tagging: Full-text search with tag-based filtering for templates.
Multi-language Support: UI available in English and another language.
Dark/Light Themes: Toggle between light and dark modes.
Mobile Responsiveness: Adaptive design for various screen sizes including mobile.
This project involved utilizing ASP.NET Core MVC with Entity Framework, and integrating libraries for markdown rendering, tag clouds, and drag-and-drop file uploads.
